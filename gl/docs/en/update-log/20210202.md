# 20210202 Version Update

## Add `.skeeetch` file support

Now you may click the down arrow (like &#9047;) on a file icon in the repository to download the `.skeeetch` file of this paper. The `.skeeetch` file can be reopened later or ported to other computers. Open a `.skeeetch` file by dragging it into the Skeeetch window.

## Add multiple window disabling mechanism

To ensure the stability and compatibility, Skeeetch will now force disable opening multiple Skeeetch windows. This is to better handle the system resources, and deal with browser crash.
