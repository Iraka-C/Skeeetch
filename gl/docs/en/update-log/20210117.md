# 20210117 Version Update

## New: Copy the whole paper to the clipboard

Now you may use `Ctrl+Space+C` to copy all the contents on the paper into the clipboard.

`Ctrl+C` is still "copy current layer/group".

## Color to opacity

Fixed the bug when trying to convert an image larger than viewport (paper size), only part of the image is affected.

Now `col > opa` tool (brush list - tools - col>opa) handles arbitrary size of image.

## Paper rotation

Fixed the bug when dragging the rotation value, it may overflow out of the -180°~180° range.

## Optimization on pencil renderer

Changed the logic of brush renderer calling the pencil renderer. On low performance machines, this may boost the rendering speed up to 80% more.

## Fix pixel position aberration on some browsers.

In Chromium based browsers (Chrome, Edge, etc.) on Windows, there might be a 1px bias vertically between the brush and the canvas. This might result from the confliction between WebGL implementation and  DOM position calculation.

Fixed by applying a sub-pixel bias on the top.

## Optimization on database (MyForage) performance

Add asynchronous save API to MyForage for better performance, especially consecutive writings on a same key (like when undo/redo several steps).
