# 20210119 Version Update

## Optimization of refresh rate calculation

Add an option of automatic refresh rate (Setting-Performance-Refresh Rate: Auto). This update will enforce all client to have the Refresh Rate: Auto setting, which enhances the performance on low-end machines or heavy tasks. If the Auto setting causes flickering or lags, please change this option into a fixed value (Fast, 60, 30, or 12)

## Fixed the stroke smoothness algorithm

On some low performance devices or browsers, the stroke will not be smoothed even if Brush Menu-Stylus-Smoothness is enabled. This update use a modified time interpolation method to solve this problem.
